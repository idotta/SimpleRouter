## Priority: CRITICAL 🔴

## Location
`SimpleRouter.Avalonia/RouteViewHost.cs:30`

## Issue Description
Event handler is subscribed to the router's `OnRouteChanged` event but never unsubscribed when the Router changes or the control is disposed. This causes a memory leak in applications with dynamic router changes.

**Current Code:**
```csharp
router.OnRouteChanged += Router_OnRouteChanged;
```

## Impact
- Memory leaks in applications with dynamic router changes
- Event handlers remain in memory even after the control is disposed
- Can lead to increased memory consumption over time

## Fix Required

```csharp
protected override void OnPropertyChanged(AvaloniaPropertyChangedEventArgs change)
{
    base.OnPropertyChanged(change);
    switch (change.Property.Name)
    {
        case nameof(Router):
            // Unsubscribe from old router
            if (change.OldValue is IRouter oldRouter)
            {
                oldRouter.OnRouteChanged -= Router_OnRouteChanged;
            }
            
            // Subscribe to new router
            if (change.NewValue is IRouter newRouter)
            {
                newRouter.OnRouteChanged += Router_OnRouteChanged;
                NavigateToRoute(newRouter.Current);
            }
            break;
    }
}
```

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement unsubscription logic for old router events
- [ ] Add proper disposal pattern
- [ ] Add unit test to verify event handler cleanup
- [ ] Add memory leak test

## Phase
**Phase 1: Critical Fixes** (Required for Production)
